# Owl Slider

Owl Slider is a sample slideshow developed using JavaScript. This project was created with the aim of improving my JavaScript skills.

## Features

- The slideshow includes next and previous buttons for navigation.
- The active slide is highlighted differently from the other slides.
- The position, size, and perspective of the slides are modified to create a dynamic effect.
- Transition effects such as blur and opacity are applied between slides.

## Usage

1- Create a div element with the class "slider" in the relevant HTML file.
2- Place slide elements with the class "item" inside the "slider" div.
3- Add HTML buttons with the IDs "next" and "prev" for the next and previous buttons, respectively.
4- Include the necessary JavaScript code in your JavaScript file to enable Owl Slider.
